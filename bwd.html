                            <p>Better World by Design is a student-led initiative at Brown University and Rhode Island School of Design that celebrates the interdisciplinary collaboration between designers, educators, innovators, and learners. We envision a world where design-thinking is accessible to everyone and aim to discuss, educate, and explore ways that design can center alternative narratives. Through our efforts, we hope to catalyze transformative change on local and global scales.</p>

                            <p>A variety of projects ranging from concept ideation to event planning for our main initiative—the Better World x Design Conference. I participated in all aspects of the planning process, as my team and I coordinated materials, food, travel, and hotel accommodations. Throughout the year, we also hosted biomaterials workshops and panels with artists and designers to educate the RISD, Brown, and Providence communities on circularity within the design process. This year, I was also able to help secure a corporate sponsorship from the design firm 2x4 at the highest sponsorship tier to support our fall conference. Partnering with such a multidisciplinary and forward-thinking firm that continues to push innovation within the branding space was truly a dream opportunity.</p>
