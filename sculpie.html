                            <p>Sculpie is an emotional expression toolkit intended for use within a clinical art therapy setting. Sculpie includes various symbols, each with a unique color, weight, and texture to help art therapy clients sculpt complex emotions. All components are held together by embedded magnets within each element, providing a satisfying and grounding tactile experience.</p>

            <div><h2>WHY ART THERAPY?</h2></div>
            <div><p>At the start of this project, I “brain-dumped” my thoughts onto a MIRO board. I wrote down everything I was interested in creating, topics that intrigued me, problems I wished to solve, and more.</p> <p>therapy sat at the intersection of everything my brainstorming pointed toward. It offered a space where I could create tactile products that support people on a deeply personal level. I was drawn to how, at its core, art therapy is an indirect, calming, safe, and deeply personal form of communication.</p><p>I ultimately settled on the following "how might we" statement to drive my creative process for this project.</p>

            <span><i>How might we… make art therapy more approachable for adults and accessible for motor compromised individuals?</i><span>

            <div><p>Survey of 40+ individuals material and color in relation to emotion
I was able to conduct a survey with 40 individuals with ages ranging from 10-65 years old.</p>

<p>In the survey I asked participants which colors, textures, memories, and foods they associated with the emotions of comfort, fear, frustration, and isolation. Data collected from the survey was then compiled and organized using a MIRO board where I drew connections between similar ideas and tallied the most common responses.</p>

<p>This research process informed many of the design choices, including the color and form of my initial sketches and ideas.</p></div>

            <div><p>Expert Interview with <a href="https://parnellemdr.com/members/stephanie-machado-jenkins/" target="_blank">Stephanie Jenkins</a> a professional art and experience therapist</p>
<p>Consulting an art therapist was incredibly valuable to my design process, as it gave me deeper insight into Mrs. Jenkins’s practice and the broader field of art therapy.
</p>
<p>Below are examples from one of her clients’ sand-tray therapy sessions. Mrs. Jenkins maintains an extensive collection of symbolic objects and two sand trays—one dry and one wet—where clients are encouraged to “play” and organize their thoughts and emotions through tactile expression.</p></div>

            <div><h2>RESEARCH TAKEAWAYS</h2></div>
            <div>
<p>• Symbols help people feel safe when expressing their emotions and serve as a non-direct form of communication.
</p>  

<p>• Art therapists often observe the process of art-making more than the final product.
</p> 

<p>• Art therapy clients often create artwork that can be predictive of future circumstances.
</p>  

<p>• Artwork created by clients is always documented and later reflected on by the therapist.
</p> 

<p>• In art therapy, there are no prompts—clients have total creative freedom and agency.

                <p>All mid-fidelity and high-fidelity prototyping and modeling was done using CAD modeling (Fusion 360) and 3D printed (FDM Extrusion). The mid-fidelity models I printed were extremely helpful as it allowed me to get a sense of the size, weight, and feel of the objects.</p>

                <p>Each 3D-printed component was sanded, finished, and coated with a colored pigment. Insights from my initial user research, specifically on how different colors evoke certain emotion, strongly informed the final color and finish choices of each piece.</p><p> first started the process with sketches and experimenting with different color schemes to get my initial ideas going.</p>

            <div><h2>PERSONAL REFLECTION</h2></div><p>Sculpie was a deeply rewarding process. Through this project, I realized my desire as a designer to create products and experiences that resonate with people on an emotional level. It opened the door to my interest in art therapy and helped me understand the powerful impact that making and play can have on one’s mental health. Grounded in research, my approach allowed me to develop a thoughtful, well-informed product for the art therapy space.</p>
