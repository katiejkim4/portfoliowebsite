                            <p>Sculpie is an emotional expression toolkit intended for use within a clinical art therapy
                                setting. Sculpie includes various symbols, each with a unique color, weight, and texture
                                to help art therapy clients sculpt complex emotions. All components are held together by
                                embedded magnets within each element, providing a satisfying and grounding tactile
                                experience.</p>

                            <p>At the start of this project, I “brain-dumped” my thoughts onto a MIRO board. I wrote down
                            everything I was interested in creating, topics that intrigued me, problems I wished to
                            solve, and more. Art therapy sat at the intersection of everything my brainstorming pointed
                            toward. It offered a space where I could create tactile products that had the ability to
                            support people on a deeply personal level. I was drawn to how, at its core, art therapy was
                            an indirect, calming, safe, and deeply personal form of communication.</p>

Data collected from the survey was then compiled and organized using a MIRO board, where I drew connections between similar ideas and tallied the most common responses.
