                        <span>PROBLEM</span>
                        <p>Traditional art therapy tools depend heavily on fine motor control, grip strength, and sustained dexterity. For individuals with motor-compromised limitations, this creates physical barriers to participation. When the act of creating becomes frustrating or inaccessible, emotional and creative expression is restricted, limiting the therapeutic benefit of an art therapy session.</p>

                        <span>SOLUTION</span>
                        <p>Sculpie reimagines art therapy tools and creative expression through modular, magnetically connected sculptural symbols that prioritize sensory engagement over fine motor precision. With each symbol varying in color, weight, and texture, Sculpie allows clients to construct and externalize complex emotions through intuitive assembly. The embedded magnets provide grounding tactile feedback, transforming the act of expression into an accessible, satisfying, and inclusive experience.

                        <p>My research gave me an intensive understanding of the needs of my users, from what they feared to what they enjoyed about art therapy. From my user interviews, there seemed to be a concern regarding skill when starting art therapy. I wanted Sculpie to feel intuitive, non-threatening, and approachable so that regardless of skill level or age anyone would feel welcome to engage in creative expression. Research proved to be an essential step in informing my design decisions. For example, the colors identified through my user survey directly influenced the color palette and textures of the final symbols. From my expert interview with Mrs. Jenkins, I learned that symbols help people feel safe when expressing their emotions and serve as a non-direct form of communication—a goal I ultimately aimed to achieve with the Sculpie kit.
